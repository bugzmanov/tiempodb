Goals:
* InfluxDB compatible line protocol
* InfluxDB compatible query language (to be supported by grafana)


Ideas:
* SIMD instructions to do aggregations 
* NO mmap to support more stable latency and performance
* Fuzzy testing of storage engine
* Better CPU utilization in ingestion pipeline: network card -> CPUs
* Data sketches (maybe)
